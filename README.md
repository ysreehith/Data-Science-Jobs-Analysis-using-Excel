# Data Science Jobs Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data science job salaries, job counts, and required skills using Excel. The dataset is processed and visualized using various Excel functionalities, including Pivot Tables, Charts, Power Query, and interactive filters. The insights derived from the analysis help understand salary trends, job distributions, and key data skills in demand.

## File Structure
- **Dataset (Worksheet 1):** Raw job data used for analysis.
- **Salary Dashboard (Worksheet 2):** Visualization of salary trends.
- **Job Count by Title (Worksheet 3):** Breakdown of job postings by job title.
- **Job Count by Month (Worksheet 4):** Monthly job trends analysis.
- **Job Skills Table (Worksheet 5):** Processed data using Power Query.
- **Top Data Skills (Worksheet 6):** Insights into in-demand data skills.

## Excel Skills Used

### 1. Data Science Salary Dashboard
**Charts:**
- Horizontal bar chart for visual comparison of median salaries by job title.
- Map chart to visualize median salaries globally.
- Vertical bar chart for comparison of median salaries by job type.
